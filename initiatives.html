        Da Una Mano (Give a Hand) Initiative
      </h3>
        <p class="margin">
          A club started with the aim of donating custom 3D-printed prosthetic hands and arms for individuals who need them, predominantly children.Through the program E-nable, makers and clients are connected so that they can exchange information like measurements and custom preferences. The club itself allows high school students to become involved in the process and help others, learning skills like CAD modeling along the way. In July 2018, Leslie and I had the opportunity to present our work at Google Cloud Next '18 in San Francisco alongside Google for Education (https://trib.in/2LNabIQ).

        A Night in Their Shoes
      </h3>
        <p class="margin">
          A homelessness community project, where the community-oriented club Think Tank raised awareness for homelessness within the general area of Franklin Park by spending a night in cardboard boxes in solidarity and living off of what people offered during the night. Prior to the event, Think Tank ran a canned food drive with the aim of donating all the food to the East Leyden food pantry for anyone in need.
